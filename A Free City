A moneyless city!
http://opalternative.tk/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20

I believe that this could be changed from a current one, one which is underdeveloped in internal areas; most of the materials can be free and in this way, the City government would be for it.
This kind of change would trigger a huge influx of new residents who are, interested in growing their own food, etc.
A city without the land values would work, the only politics necessarily required for this aspect being, the mechanism so that current tenants get the (retail, residential, etc) outlet and that current owners are compensated.
Freed from the pressure of profit return, the citizens could then out-flow a huge output of creativity, and without money we'd have community.

These sites are dedicated free, which actually gets there.

Thread in a Facebook group had much discussion, and 6 yes's, as in, we would move to there and help set it up. 
Remains one of the most popular threads on opAlternative forum.
An idea whose time has come.. anyone request a City example, or know city government in a place?
